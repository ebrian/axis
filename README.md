# Axis 0.1-alpha
The fun and useless toy language written in JavaScript. Axis is a multi-paradigm, scripted, optionally object-oriented, imperative programming language. Executed with the standard Node.js CLI binary, Axis is ultimately JIT compiled with Google's V8 Engine. By being backed by Node.js, Axis gains access to the low-level APIs provided by Node.js's core. Current benchmarks have Axis being roughly 50% the speed of Node.js. The goal is to get Axis to run at 80% the speed of Node.js or more.

Axis uses peek, read, and rewind interpretation and constructs the object model in memory until it needs to be used.
